# BLIND-S-AIDE
The increased use of technology and it’s limitless opportunities have made it inevitable for the present generations to apply the Internet technology to the fullest. Email being
one of the most widely used features of the Internet serves as the basic prerequisite. Apart from normal users, the visually impaired one’s face challenges when it comes to
using the internet in spite of the availability of various screen readers.
We intend to create a Voice based Emailsystem for visually impaired people, which is developed as an application which helps the blind and handicapped people to access mails
easily and efficiently.
